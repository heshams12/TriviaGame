# Trivia Game
I created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.

It's a sports trivia form with multiple choice questions. The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.
The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
the player can only pick one answer per question.
